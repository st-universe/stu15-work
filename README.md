### STU V1.5 - Setup
- works with php5. maybe
- Files seem to be in ANSI format. Consider that to avoid unexpected changes
  (e.g. to special characters) performed by your code editor.


1. Copy and edit config
    ````shell 
    cp inc/config.inc.dist.php inc/config.inc.php
    ````

2. Run `db_structure.sql` in the database (schemas only)
